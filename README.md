# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

#### Background:

This challenge was completed as a preparation exercise for a scenario that I will likely encounter as a web developer. I was provided with a starter code which I needed to modify in line with the user story and acceptance criteria.

#### Problem:

Marketing agency hired me to make their web application optimised for search engines.

#### Key learnings:

Refactoring a codebase to follow accessiblity standards.

## Getting started

#### How do I download the files?

- If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

#### Integrate with your tools

- On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Above the list of files, click Code.
- Copy SSH or HTTPS key
- On your Terminal (Mac) / Git bash (Microsoft) make sure you are in the directiory you want to clone this in - Use below command followed by a SSH/HTTPS code and hit enter

git clone

- You are good to go!

P.S. If you are using <a src="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop">GitHub Desktop</a>, when you hit green Code button, just select 'Open with GitHub Desktop' and follow their instruction.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
