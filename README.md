# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

#### Background:

- By completing this project I will be more prepared for a scenario that I will likely encounter as a web developer
- This project is "on-the-job ticket", meaning I was provided a starter code which I need to modify

#### Problem:

- Accessiblity.
- Accessiblity is an important consideration for businesses when it comes to web development. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies, i.e. video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards
- The project was completed according to a User Story and Acceptance criteria

#### Key learnings:

- Code refactoring (improved it without changing what it does) to meet a certain standards or implement a new technology, and to make it more accessible
- Essentially made page more accessible to both users and developers

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
